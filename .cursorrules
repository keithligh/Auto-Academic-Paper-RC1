# Antigravity Agent Rules

1.  **AVOID `replace_file_content` for multi-line blocks**: When editing code, do NOT try to match large blocks of text. The `TargetContent` matching is fragile.
2.  **Prefer `write_to_file` (Overwrite)**: If you need to change more than 3 lines of code, rewrite the entire file or function rather than trying to splice it.
3.  **Use Single-Line Anchors**: If you must use `replace_file_content`, use a SINGLE line of unique code as the `TargetContent` anchor, rather than a block.
4.  **Verify Context**: Before applying an edit, verify the indentation matches exactly.
