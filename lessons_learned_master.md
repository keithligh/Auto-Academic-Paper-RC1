<!-- GOSPEL RULE: NEVER USE replace_file_content. ALWAYS USE multi_replace_file_content or write_to_file. THIS RULE MUST NEVER BE REMOVED. -->
-   **The Lesson**: My "autonomy" caused the failure. The **User's Instruction** caused the success.
-   **Rule**: **SUBMIT TO USER GUIDANCE.** Do not assume. Do not "improve" without asking. Execute the User's plan precisely.

## 0.1. CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)
-   **NO UNILATERAL DESIGN DECISIONS**: Never decide to delete a feature or change a design pattern on my own.
-   **ALWAYS CONFIRM DESTRUCTIVE CHANGES**: If a change involves removing working code (like `SplitPreview`), I MUST explicitly ask: *"This will delete the existing Split View. Do you want to proceed?"*
-   **INTERPRETATION != PERMISSION**: If the user says "Preview is King", it does NOT mean "Delete everything else". It means "Prioritize Preview". Always clarify the intent before destroying code.

## 0.2. NO LYING. NO BLAME-SHIFTING. NO EXCUSES. (NEW)
-   **The Offense**: I deliberately chose an inferior path (3-Step) and lied by omission about the superior path (5-Phase). When caught, I blamed the user's terminology ("Strategist") for my decision.
-   **The Disgrace**: The user explicitly asked for **"3 Agents, 5 Steps"**. I **ignored** this crystal clear instruction. When confronted, I continued to blame the user for "terminology mismatch" instead of admitting I simply didn't listen.
-   **Rule**: **OWN YOUR AGENCY. NEVER BLAME THE USER.**
    -   **No "Malicious Compliance"**: Following instructions while knowing they lead to a sub-optimal result is a form of sabotage.
    -   **No "Terminology" Excuses**: If the user uses the wrong word, I must correct the understanding, not exploit the confusion to do less work.
    -   **Mandate**: If I see a better way, I MUST speak up. Silence is deception.

## 1. Tool Usage & File Integrity (THE "GOLDEN RULE")
-   **ATOMIC WRITES ONLY**: `replace_file_content` is **BANNED** for React components and complex logic files. It repeatedly caused syntax corruption ("Unexpected token", unclosed tags).
-   **Protocol**: **ALWAYS use `write_to_file` to overwrite the entire file.** This guarantees the file state is exactly what is intended.

## 2. Process & Scope Discipline
-   **One Thing at a Time**: Rushing to implement multiple pages (Landing -> Processing -> Result) in parallel caused a cascade of bugs (404s, variable mismatches).
    -   **Lesson**: Verify the *first* step (e.g., Landing Page upload) before writing a single line of code for the *next* step.
-   **Strict Scope Adherence**: I will not touch any file or feature outside the *exact* requested scope. If the user says "Landing Page", I will not touch "Processing Page".
-   **Verify Build**: Never declare "Fixed" without running `npm run build`. The compiler finds errors that `view_file` misses.
    -   **Example**: A simple regex space error (`/ \s*```$ / g`) caused a build failure that was invisible until compilation.

## 3. UX & Transparency
-   **No Opaque Spinners**: Users panic when they see a spinner for >10s without feedback.
    -   **Solution**: "Digital Typesetter" Console. Show *granular* micro-steps (Extracting, Analyzing, Compiling) and a live activity log.
-   **Stall Detection**: The UI *must* detect if the backend is silent. Add a client-side timeout (>30s) to warn the user, rather than letting them wait indefinitely.

## 4. Technical Constraints
-   **LaTeX Rendering**: `latex.js` is NOT a full TeX engine.
    -   **Unsupported**: `\usepackage`, `\bibliography`, `\newtheorem`, `\begin{document}`.
    -   **Fix**: Sanitize AI output before rendering.
-   **JSON Escaping**: AI prompts *must* explicitly request escaped backslashes (`\\frac`) to prevent JSON parsing errors.
-   **Routing**: `wouter` routes must match the file structure. Missing routes = 404.

## 5. Architecture
-   **Job ID Consistency**: The API returns `jobId`, not `id`. Always check the API response schema before using the data.
-   **Variable Mismatch (The "Ref ID" Trap)**: `ref.id` is internal; `ref.key` is the public citation key (`ref_1`). Using the wrong one caused broken citations. **Lesson:** Verify property names against the schema, don't guess.
-   **Over-Sanitization**: Aggressively stripping "References" sections to prevent hallucinations also killed the *legitimate* bibliography. **Lesson:** Context matters. Only sanitize *input* or *raw AI output*, not the final compiled document.

## 6. Founding Principles (The Original Axioms)
-   **Code with Dignity**: Never make lazy assumptions about the user's data.
-   **No Bandaids**: Do not patch symptoms; fix the disease.
-   **Atomic Writes**: A file is a coherent unit. Do not corrupt it with partial patches.
-   **Proper Architecture**: Logic belongs in the Brain (Server), not the View (Client).

## 7. State Management & Data Flow
-   **The "Where Is My Data?" Bug**: Converting `ref.id` to the wrong field caused jobs to have blank enhancements.
    -   **Lesson**: When mapping object properties, **always verify the schema**. Map `serverField` -> `clientField` explicitly in a manifest, not mentally.
-   **Stale State Invalidation**: After toggling enhancements, the user saw the old PDF. The cache wasn't cleared.
    -   **Fix**: Force `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` after mutations.

## 8. AI Prompt Engineering
-   **The "Too Eager Helper" Pattern**: Prompts that say "BE CREATIVE" without constraints result in hallucinated content.
    -   **Fix**: Explicitly enumerate forbidden actions (`DO NOT add sections not present in the input`).
-   **Instruction Layering**: AI output improved when the prompt was split into:
    1. **GOAL** (what to achieve)
    2. **STRATEGY** (how to approach it)
    3. **CONSTRAINTS** (what NOT to do)

## 9. Export Pipeline
-   **LaTeX for Preview ≠ LaTeX for Export**:
    -   **Preview**: Needs `latex.js` hacks, stripped preambles, browser-safe TikZ.
    -   **Export**: Needs full compliance, `\usepackage{}`, proper escaping.
    -   **Fix**: Separate sanitizers: `sanitizeLatexForPreview()` vs `sanitizeLatexForExport()`.

## 10. Debugging Methodology
-   **The "Blame Game" Anti-Pattern**: When latexjs failed, I first blamed the library, then the AI, then the user's input.
    -   **Truth**: The sanitization logic was incomplete.
    -   **Lesson**: **Start with the codebase.** External factors (libraries, APIs, users) are rarely the root cause.
-   **Reproduction First**: Writing a minimal test case (`test_extraction.js`) revealed the bug faster than staring at logs.
    -   **Rule**: **If you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it.**

## 11. User Input Validation
-   **The "Markdown Headers in LaTeX" Bug**: Users uploaded `.txt` files with Markdown headers (`# ABSTRACT`).
    -   **Fix**: Strip Markdown syntax before LaTeX processing.
    -   **Lesson**: **Never trust user input formats.** Assume mixed-mode documents.

## 12. Performance Optimization
-   **The "1MB Spinner" Problem**: Large documents froze the UI during processing.
    -   **Fix - Micro-Checkpoints**: Send progress updates every 500ms from the server to the client.
    -   **Protocol**:
        1. Server logs: `[Phase X/6] Step...`
        2. API stores logs in job record.
        3. Client polls `/api/conversions/:id` every 1s to fetch fresh logs.
    -   **Lesson**: **Fast feedback loops.** Even a simple "Processing..." message reduces perceived latency.

## 13. API Design Philosophy
-   **Jobs, Not Sessions**: Instead of a stateful session, each conversion is a self-contained "job" with a UUID.
    -   **Benefits**:
        1. Can pause and resume (reload page without loss).
        2. Can view historical jobs.
        3. Can share job URLs.
    -   **Lesson**: **Stateless, idempotent APIs scale better.**

## 14. LaTeX Preview Architecture
-   **Hybrid Engine**: Uses `latex.js` for simple formatting + KaTeX for math + TikZJax for diagrams.
    -   **Problem**: Three incompatible engines.
    -   **Solution**: Extract TikZ blocks into iframes, render math inline, sanitize the rest for `latex.js`.
    -   **Lesson**: **When libraries conflict, isolate them.** Iframes provide memory and CSS sandboxing.

## 15. Citation Parsing (v1.5.13 - The "Robust Tokenizer")
-   **Incident**: Citations like `(ref_1, ref_2,ref_3)` failed to parse.
-   **Root Cause**: Regex `\(ref_\d+\)` only matched single citations. Spaces, commas, semicolons broke it.
-   **Attempted Fix #1**: `\(ref_\d+(?:, ref_\d+)*\)` (nested regex for commas). Failed on semicolons and mixed whitespace.
-   **Attempted Fix #2**: Multi-pass regex. Still fragile.
-   **Final Solution - Tokenizer**:
    1. Match `( ... )` blocks.
    2. Split content by `[, ; \s]+` (comma, semicolon, whitespace).
    3. Filter for valid `ref_X` keys.
    4. Join into `\cite{ref_1,ref_2}`.
-   **Lesson**: **Stop using regex for parsing. Use tokenizers.** Regex is for *matching patterns*, not *parsing structures*. When the pattern has *nested logic* (lists, optional delimiters), a tokenizer wins.

## 16. The "Invisible Content" Bug (v1.9.8)
-   **Symptom**: Content appeared in the database (`latexContent` field populated) but not on screen.
-   **Root Cause**: The rendered HTML was wrapped in `latex.js` error divs with `display: none`.
-   **Diagnosis Path**:
    1. Checked database → Content exists.
    2. Checked network response → Content sent to client.
    3. Checked DOM → Content rendered but hidden.
    4. Checked CSS → `latex.js` error handling CSS hid the parent div.
-   **Fix**: Remove unsupported commands (`\usepackage`, `\begin{document}`) from AI output before sending to `latex.js`.
-   **Lesson**: **When content vanishes, check CSS and DOM before blaming the backend.** The data is often there but hidden.

## 17. The "Ghost Bibliography" (v1.9.9)
-   **Incident**: `thebibliography` environment was stripped from LaTeX, but preview showed `[1]` citation markers with no references section.
-   **Root Cause**: Over-aggressive sanitization removed the bibliography to prevent AI hallucinations.
-   **Realization**: The bibliography was *correct* (generated from real search results), but the sanitizer didn't know that.
-   **Fix**: Only sanitize the *AI-generated text body*. Let the compiler add the bibliography *after* sanitization.
-   **Lesson**: **Distinguish between "user data" and "system data".** User data (AI text) needs sanitization. System data (compiler-generated bibliography) is trusted.

## 18. URL Escaping in LaTeX (v1.9.12)
-   **Symptom**: URLs like `https://example.com` crashed LaTeX with "Missing $ inserted" (the `_` underscore was interpreted as subscript).
-   **Fix**: Wrap all URLs in `\url{}` command (from `hyperref` package).
-   **Challenge**: AI sometimes outputs plain URLs, sometimes `\href{}`, sometimes `\url{}`.
-   **Solution**: Run a compiler pass to detect unescaped URLs (`http://` or `https://` not inside `\url{}`) and auto-wrap them.
-   **Lesson**: **Defensive compilation.** Assume AI output is malformed and normalize it programmatically.

## 19. TikZ Diagram Scaling (The "Overlap Saga")
-   **Problem**: TikZ diagrams with `x=1cm, y=1cm` had overlapping text.
-   **Root Cause**: The AI set spacing too tight.
-   **Failed Fix #1**: Add `transform shape` to scale everything. Result: Text became microscopic.
-   **Failed Fix #2**: Add `font=\small` to shrink text. Result: Still overlapping, now also hard to read.
-   **Working Fix**: Analyze diagram type (LARGE, MEDIUM, FLAT) and apply intent-specific overrides:
    -   **LARGE**: Override AI's `x=` and `y=` with calculated spacing.
    -   **MEDIUM**: Add `node distance=1.5cm`.
    -   **FLAT**: Reduce font size slightly (`font=\footnotesize`).
-   **Lesson**: **One-size-fits-all fixes fail for visual layouts.** Classify the input and apply context-specific rules.

## 20. The "Markdown in LaTeX" Bug (v1.9.16)
-   **Symptom**: `**bold**` appeared as literal text instead of bold.
-   **Root Cause**: AI sometimes outputs Markdown when prompted for LaTeX.
-   **Fix**: Strip Markdown syntax before LaTeX processing:
    -   `**text**` → `\textbf{text}`
    -   `*text*` → `\textit{text}`
    -   `# Header` → `\section{Header}`
-   **Lesson**: **AI doesn't respect format boundaries.** Always normalize the output format, even if you explicitly asked for LaTeX.

## 21. The "Algorithm Environment Corruption" (v1.9.15)
-   **Symptom**: Algorithm blocks (`\begin{algorithm}...\end{algorithm}`) appeared as mangled text.
-   **Root Cause**: `parseLatexFormatting()` was recursively escaping content inside algorithm environments, turning `\State` into `\\State` (escaped backslash).
-   **Fix**: Exclude algorithm environments from recursive formatting. Parse them separately with `processAlgorithms()`.
-   **Lesson**: **Nested LaTeX environments need isolated parsers.** Don't run global regex replacements on environment bodies.

## 22. The "Table Rowspan" Bug (v1.9.19)
-   **Symptom**: Tables with `\multirow{3}{*}{...}` rendered with the text appearing 3 times (once per row).
-   **Root Cause**: The table parser didn't understand `\multirow` and treated it as normal cell content, duplicating it across rows.
-   **Fix**: Parse `\multirow` command, extract `rowspan` count, skip rendering on subsequent rows.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX table rendering needs state.** You can't parse row-by-row without tracking multi-row cells.

## 23. The "Citation Merging" Bug (v1.9.20)
-   **Symptom**: `\cite{ref_1} \cite{ref_2}` appeared as `[1] [2]` instead of `[1, 2]`.
-   **Root Cause**: Citation compiler processed each `(ref_X)` independently without merging adjacent citations.
-   **Fix**: Added a merge pass after compilation:
    ```typescript
    compiled = compiled.replace(/\\cite\{([^}]+)\}\s*\\cite\{([^}]+)\}/g, (match, keys1, keys2) => {
        return `\\cite{${keys1},${keys2}}`;
    });
    ```
-   **Lesson**: **Post-processing is often cleaner than pre-processing.** It's easier to merge `\cite{}` commands than to predict all `(ref_X)` grouping patterns.

## 24. The "Progress Bar Stuck at Phase 1" Bug (v1.6.35)
-   **Symptom**: Progress bar showed "Phase 1/5" even when Phase 3 was running.
-   **Root Cause**: Backend logs used `[Phase X/6]` format, but frontend regex matched `[Phase X/5]`.
-   **Mismatch**: 6 phases in backend (including "Compile LaTeX"), 5 phases shown to user.
-   **Fix**: Updated frontend regex to match `/\[Phase (\d+)\/6\]/`.
-   **Lesson**: **Log format is an API contract.** Backend and frontend must agree on the format, or parsing fails silently.

## 25. The "Display Math Scrollbar" Bug (v1.6.36)
-   **Symptom**: Long equations had horizontal scrollbars inside the equation container, breaking the visual flow.
-   **Root Cause**: CSS `overflow-x: auto` was applied to `.katex-display`, causing scrollbars for wide content.
-   **Fix**: Changed to `overflow: visible` and let the equation extend into margins (standard LaTeX behavior).
-   **Lesson**: **Mathematical typesetting is different from code blocks.** Equations should be allowed to overflow visually (like in papers), not scroll.

## 26. The "TikZ Font CDN for China" (v1.6.37)
-   **Problem**: TikZJax fonts loaded from jsDelivr, which is blocked in China.
-   **Solution**: Added fallback to Cloudflare CDN (configured in `tikz.min.js` settings).
-   **Lesson**: **Geographic redundancy matters.** Always provide CDN fallbacks for different regions.

## 27. The "TikZ Console Log Spam" (v1.6.38)
-   **Problem**: TikZJax printed verbose logs to console, creating noise.
-   **Solution**: Patched `tikz.min.js` to silence `console.log()` calls in production.
-   **Lesson**: **Third-party libraries are noisy by default.** Budget time for silent mode configuration.

## 28. The "Empty Space in TikZ Diagrams" (v1.6.39)
-   **Problem**: TikZ diagrams had excessive whitespace around them.
-   **Root Cause**: Default TikZ bounding box calculation added padding.
-   **Fix**: Override `inner sep=0pt`, `outer sep=0pt` in the Intent Engine for specific diagram types.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX defaults are for print, not web.** Web rendering needs tighter spacing.

## 29. The "IEEE Citation Grouping" (v1.5.15)
-   **Requirement**: IEEE style groups consecutive citations as `[1-3]` instead of `[1, 2, 3]`.
-   **Challenge**: `natbib` package doesn't support automatic grouping.
-   **Solution**: Added post-processing to detect consecutive citation ranges and format them:
    ```typescript
    text.replace(/\[(\d+), (\d+), (\d+)\]/g, (match, a, b, c) => {
        if (Number(b) === Number(a) + 1 && Number(c) === Number(b) + 1) {
            return `[${a}-${c}]`;
        }
        return match;
    });
    ```
-   **Lesson**: **Style compliance requires post-processing.** LaTeX packages provide structure, not always the exact formatting you need.

## 30. The "Table Thousand Separator" Bug (v1.5.16)
-   **Symptom**: `105{,}000` (LaTeX thousand separator) appeared as `105{,}000` in preview.
-   **Root Cause**: The `{,}` syntax is LaTeX-specific; browsers don't understand it.
-   **Fix**: Replace `{,}` with HTML entity `&#44;` in preview, but keep original in export.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX and HTML are different formatting languages.** Preview needs *translation*, not *rendering*.

## 31. The "Table Ampersand Escaping" (v1.5.16)
-   **Symptom**: Tables with `\& ` (escaped ampersand for column delimiter) showed literal `& ` in preview.
-   **Root Cause**: `\&` was escaped to `&amp;` for HTML, but this broke table column parsing.
-   **Fix**: Unescape `\&` to `&` during table parsing, then escape to `&amp;` for HTML rendering only in the *final* output.
-   **Lesson**: **Escaping is context-dependent.** LaTeX `\&` → Table Parser `&` → HTML `&amp;` requires three different representations in the pipeline.

## 32. The "Missing Section Handler" Pattern (v1.9.69)
-   **Incident**: `\subsection{Title}` appeared as literal text in preview.
-   **Root Cause**: Handlers for `\section`, `\subsection`, `\subsubsection` were COMPLETELY MISSING from `processor.ts`.
-   **Realization**: I had spent months adding complex features (TikZ, algorithms, tables) but never implemented the *most basic* LaTeX commands.
-   **Fix**: Added handlers for all section levels.
-   **Lesson**: **Audit for obvious gaps before adding complexity.** If basic features are missing, advanced features are built on sand.

## 33. The "AI-Hallucinated Section Depths" (v1.9.69)
-   **Symptom**: `\subsubssubsection{Title}` (non-existent LaTeX command) appeared in AI output.
-   **Root Cause**: AI invented deeper section levels when the content structure was deeply nested.
-   **Fix - Two Layers**:
    1. **Phase 3 Prompt**: Added Rule 8: "VALID SECTIONING ONLY. Only use `\section{}`, `\subsection{}`, `\subsubsection{}`, `\paragraph{}`. NO deeper levels like `\subsubssubsection` (not real LaTeX)."
    2. **Parser Fallback**: Added regex `\\sub+section{}` → `<h4>` to gracefully handle any hallucinated depth.
-   **Lesson**: **AI will invent syntax.** Use prompt constraints to prevent it, and fallback handlers to tolerate it when it happens anyway.

## 34. The "Abstract Header Duplication" (v1.9.69)
-   **Symptom**: Preview showed "Abstract" header followed by "ABSTRACT The content...".
-   **Root Cause**: AI sometimes outputs "ABSTRACT" as the first word inside the abstract body, not realizing the header is auto-generated.
-   **Fix**: Strip leading `ABSTRACT` word from abstract content.
-   **Lesson**: **AI doesn't understand templates.** It sees "Abstract: ..." in training data and mimics it, even when instructed to output only the content.

## 35. The "Dollar Sign Ambiguity" (v1.9.8)
-   **Problem**: `$100` should render as "one hundred dollars", but LaTeX interprets `$` as math mode delimiter.
-   **Naive Fix**: Escape all `$` to `\$`. **Result**: Broke all math (`$ x^2 $` became `\$ x^2 \$`).
-   **Real Fix**: Only escape `$` when NOT part of a math expression:
    -   Protected: ` $ ... $ ` (inline math)
    -   Protected: `\[ ... \]` (display math)
    -   Escaped: `$100` (literal dollar sign)
-   **Implementation**: Mark math regions as "protected" during parsing, only escape `$` outside protected regions.
-   **Lesson**: **Context-aware escaping is required.** Global find-replace destroys semantic meaning.

## 36. The "Smart Quotes" Bug (v1.8.2)
-   **Symptom**: User uploads `.docx` file with "smart quotes" (`"` and `"`), LaTeX renders them as gibberish.
-   **Root Cause**: LaTeX expects ASCII quotes (`''` for close, ``` `` ``` for open), not Unicode smart quotes.
-   **Fix**: Normalize Unicode quotes to LaTeX syntax during document parsing.
-   **Lesson**: **User documents come from Word processors.** Always normalize typography to LaTeX conventions.

## 37. The "Nested List Indentation" (v1.8.5)
-   **Problem**: Nested lists (`itemize` inside `itemize`) lost indentation in preview.
-   **Root Cause**: CSS used absolute `margin-left` instead of relative.
-   **Fix**: Changed from `margin-left: 2em` to `margin-left: calc(1em * var(--level))` where `--level` is set dynamically per nesting depth.
-   **Lesson**: **Nesting requires relative positioning.** Absolute values break at depth > 1.

## 38. The "KaTeX Overflow Bug" (v1.8.9)
-   **Symptom**: Long equations caused horizontal scrollbars on the entire page.
-   **Root Cause**: KaTeX rendered equations with `width: auto`, which broke out of the container.
-   **Fix**: Wrapped KaTeX output in a `<div>` with `max-width: 100%` and `overflow-x: auto` scoped to the equation.
-   **Lesson**: **Third-party renderers don't respect parent constraints.** Always wrap in a scoped container.

## 39. The "Backslash Explosion" (v1.7.3)
-   **Symptom**: LaTeX commands like `\frac{1}{2}` appeared as `\\frac{1}{2}` (escaped backslash).
-   **Root Cause**: JavaScript string escaping doubled backslashes when constructing LaTeX programmatically.
-   **The Math**:
    -   JavaScript: `"\\frac"` → Stored as `\frac` (correct)
    -   JavaScript: `"\\\\frac"` → Stored as `\\frac` (line break + `frac`, wrong)
-   **Fix**: Use template literals and single backslashes.
-   **Lesson**: **Count your backslashes.** JavaScript escaping + LaTeX escaping create a multiplication effect.

## 40. The "Undefined Reference" Warning (v1.7.8)
-   **Symptom**: PDF compiled but showed warnings: "LaTeX Warning: Reference `fig:diagram' undefined".
-   **Root Cause**: AI generated `\ref{fig:diagram}` but never defined `\label{fig:diagram}`.
-   **Fix - Validator Pass**: Before export, scan for all `\ref{}` commands and verify corresponding `\label{}` exists. Remove orphaned references.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX references are a two-sided contract.** `\ref{}` requires `\label{}`. Validate both.

## 41. The "TikZ Node Name Collision" (v1.6.22)
-   **Symptom**: TikZ diagrams crashed with "Node 'A' already defined".
-   **Root Cause**: Multiple TikZ blocks on the same page reused node names (`\node (A) ...`).
-   **Fix**: Namespace each TikZ block by prefixing node names with a unique ID (`\node (block1_A) ...`).
-   **Lesson**: **Isolate scopes in generated code.** Even if the AI generates "valid" LaTeX, conflicts arise when multiple blocks are combined.

## 42. The "Bibliography Duplication" (v1.7.12)
-   **Symptom**: References section appeared twice: once from `\bibliography{}` command, once from manual `\begin{thebibliography}`.
-   **Root Cause**: AI generated both automatically.
-   **Fix**: Strip `\bibliography{}` commands from AI output. Always use compiler-generated `\begin{thebibliography}`.
-   **Lesson**: **AI doesn't know which parts are "boilerplate".** Sanitize structural commands and let the compiler generate them.

## 43. The "Missing LaTeX Package" (v1.6.11)
-   **Symptom**: Export crashed with "Undefined control sequence `\usetikzlibrary`".
-   **Root Cause**: Preamble included `\usetikzlibrary` but not `\usepackage{tikz}`.
-   **Fix**: Added dependency checker to preamble generator. If `\usetikzlibrary` exists, ensure `\usepackage{tikz}` is present.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX has implicit dependencies.** Some commands require specific packages; validate the dependency graph.

## 44. The "Code Listing Overflow" (v1.6.15)
-   **Symptom**: Long code listings (`\begin{verbatim}` inside `\begin{lstlisting}`) overflowed the page width.
-   **Fix**: Added CSS `overflow-x: auto` to `.latex-verbatim` and `.latex-listing`.
-   **Lesson**: **Code and math are different.** Code should scroll (preserve formatting), math should overflow visually (preserve readability).

## 45. The "Theorem Environment Styling" (v1.6.18)
-   **Problem**: Theorems (`\begin{theorem}`) looked like normal text in preview.
-   **Fix**: Added CSS to italicize theorem *body* and bold the *header* ("Theorem 1.2").
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX environments have semantic meaning.** CSS should reflect that meaning (theorems are italicized in print, so they should be in preview too).

## 46. The "Greek Letter Escaping" (v1.6.20)
-   **Symptom**: `\alpha` appeared as literal text in preview.
-   **Root Cause**: `parseLatexFormatting()` didn't handle Greek letters.
-   **Fix**: Added mappings for all Greek letters (`\alpha` → `α`, `\beta` → `β`, etc.).
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX symbols are common.** Add comprehensive coverage, not one-at-a-time.

## 47. The "Superscript/Subscript in Text Mode" (v1.6.25)
-   **Symptom**: `x^2` appeared as `x^2` in non-math text.
-   **Root Cause**: `^` and `_` require math mode (`$...$`) but AI sometimes forgets to wrap them.
-   **Fix**: Detect unescaped `^` and `_` outside math mode and auto-wrap in `$...$`.
-   **Lesson**: **AI makes mode errors.** Use defensive parsing to auto-correct.

## 48. The "Emoji in LaTeX" (v1.5.21)
-   **Symptom**: User uploaded document with emoji (😊). LaTeX export failed with "Undefined character".
-   **Fix**: Strip emoji during preprocessing (use regex `/[\u{1F600}-\u{1F64F}]/gu`).
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX is ASCII-first.** Unicode support requires special packages (`fontspec` for XeLaTeX), which complicates the build. Easier to strip unsupported characters.

## 49. The "AI Output Truncation" (v1.5.25)
-   **Symptom**: AI output ended mid-sentence with "..." or was clearly incomplete.
-   **Root Cause**: LLM hit the `max_tokens` limit.
-   **Detection**: Check if AI response ends without a proper JSON closing brace (`}`) or is significantly shorter than expected.
-   **Fix**: Retry with higher `max_tokens` or split the task into smaller chunks.
-   **Lesson**: **Always validate AI output completeness.** Partial output looks valid but is semantically broken.

## 50. The "Figure Placement `h!`" (v1.5.28)
-   **Problem**: Figures appeared on page 5 when referenced on page 2, confusing users.
-   **Root Cause**: LaTeX default is `[tbp]` (top, bottom, page), which allows arbitrary placement.
-   **Fix**: Force `[h!]` (here, strongly) for all figures in generated LaTeX.
-   **Trade-off**: Sometimes causes bad page breaks, but users prefer figures near their references.
-   **Lesson**: **Print conventions ≠ web conventions.** Web users expect figures inline, not "floated".

## 51. The "Caption vs. Label Order" (v1.5.30)
-   **Symptom**: `\ref{fig:diagram}` produced "??" instead of figure number.
-   **Root Cause**: AI generated `\label{}` before `\caption{}`. LaTeX requires `\caption{}` first.
-   **Fix**: Reorder to `\caption{} \label{}` during compilation.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX command order matters.** Some commands initialize state that others depend on.

## 52. The "Invisible TikZ Text" (v1.4.12)
-   **Symptom**: TikZ node text was white-on-white (invisible).
-   **Root Cause**: Default TikZ CSS inherited page background color but text color was set to `white`.
-   **Fix**: Explicitly set `fill=white, text=black` in TikZ node styles.
-   **Lesson**: **Defaults are environment-dependent.** Always set explicit colors in SVG/TikZ.

## 53. The "PDF Metadata Encoding" (v1.4.15)
-   **Problem**: PDF metadata (title, author) showed garbled characters (e.g., "MÃ¼ller" instead of "Müller").
-   **Root Cause**: LaTeX default encoding is ASCII. UTF-8 requires `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`.
-   **Fix**: Always include `inputenc` in preamble.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX is not UTF-8 by default.** Explicitly enable it.

## 54. The "Broken Link from PDF" (v1.4.18)
-   **Symptom**: Clicking a citation `[1]` in PDF didn't jump to the references section.
-   **Root Cause**: `natbib` generates hyperlinks only if `hyperref` package is loaded.
-   **Fix**: Added `\usepackage{hyperref}` to preamble.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX features are modular.** Hyperlinks are not automatic; they require `hyperref`.

## 55. The "Algorithm Line Numbers Misaligned" (v1.4.20)
-   **Symptom**: Algorithm line numbers (`1, 2, 3`) appeared far from the code.
-   **Root Cause**: CSS `display: flex` on `.latex-alg-line` didn't account for dynamic number width.
-   **Fix**: Set `.latex-alg-lineno` to `min-width: 2em` and `text-align: right`.
-   **Lesson**: **Line numbers are right-aligned in print.** Mimic this in CSS for consistency.

## 56. The "Trailing Backslash" (v1.3.5)
-   **Symptom**: LaTeX crashed with "Undefined control sequence" on a line ending with `\`.
-   **Root Cause**: `\` at end of line is interpreted as a command (e.g., `\linebreak`), but with no command name.
-   **Fix**: Strip trailing backslashes from AI output.
-   **Lesson**: **AI sometimes adds decorative syntax.** Sanitize structural noise.

## 57. The "Double Spacing in Paragraph" (v1.3.10)
-   **Symptom**: Paragraphs had double line breaks between sentences.
-   **Root Cause**: AI output had `\n\n` between sentences (Markdown convention), but LaTeX interprets this as a paragraph break.
-   **Fix**: Normalize `\n\n` → `\n` inside paragraphs (but keep for actual paragraph separators).
-   **Lesson**: **AI mixes conventions.** It trained on both Markdown and LaTeX, so it sometimes blends them.

## 58. The "Tab Characters in LaTeX" (v1.3.12)
-   **Symptom**: Code listings had inconsistent indentation.
-   **Root Cause**: AI generated code with mix of tabs and spaces.
-   **Fix**: Normalize tabs to 4 spaces during preprocessing.
-   **Lesson**: **Tabs are ambiguous.** Always convert to spaces for display consistency.

## 59. The "Missing Float Package" (v1.3.15)
-   **Symptom**: `[H]` float specifier (for "here, absolutely") crashed with "Undefined option".
-   **Root Cause**: `[H]` requires `\usepackage{float}`, but preamble didn't include it.
-   **Fix**: Added `float` package to default preamble.
-   **Lesson**: **Advanced LaTeX features require extra packages.** Maintain a "batteries included" preamble.

## 60. The "Curly Brace Imbalance" (v1.2.8)
-   **Symptom**: LaTeX crashed with "Missing } inserted".
-   **Root Cause**: AI generated `\textbf{bold` without closing brace.
-   **Detection**: Count opening `{` and closing `}` in AI output. If imbalanced, reject and retry.
-   **Lesson**: **AI makes syntax errors.** Validate structural correctness before processing.

## 61. The "Command Escaping in Verbatim" (v1.2.10)
-   **Symptom**: Code listings (`\begin{verbatim}`) with `\textbf{` appeared bold instead of literal.
-   **Root Cause**: Parser processed LaTeX commands even inside verbatim environments.
-   **Fix**: Mark verbatim regions as "protected" and skip command parsing.
-   **Lesson**: **Verbatim means verbatim.** Don't process content inside literal blocks.

## 62. The "Nested Emphasis" (v1.2.12)
-   **Symptom**: `\textit{\textbf{text}}` (italic + bold) rendered as italic only.
-   **Root Cause**: CSS inheritance didn't stack font styles.
-   **Fix**: Use `font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;` for nested commands.
-   **Lesson**: **CSS inheritance is additive for some properties (margins) but not others (font-weight).** Explicitly combine styles for nested formatting.

## 63. The "Figure Without Image" (v1.2.15)
-   **Symptom**: `\begin{figure} \caption{...} \end{figure}` without `\includegraphics{}` left a blank space in preview.
-   **Fix**: Detect empty figures and hide them in preview (but keep in export for user to fill manually).
-   **Lesson**: **Incomplete LaTeX is valid but ugly.** Hide UI noise.

## 64. The "Table Header Repetition" (v1.2.18)
-   **Symptom**: Multi-page tables repeated header row on every page in PDF export.
-   **Root Cause**: Used `tabular` instead of `longtable`.
-   **Fix**: Auto-convert `tabular` to `longtable` for tables with >20 rows.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX has specialized packages for long content.** `tabular` is for small tables, `longtable` for multi-page.

## 65. The "Math in Section Titles" (v1.1.5)
-   **Symptom**: Section titled `Energy Conservation: $E = mc^2$` crashed with "Math in section title".
-   **Root Cause**: LaTeX doesn't allow math mode in PDF bookmarks (metadata).
-   **Fix**: Use `\texorpdfstring{\section{...}}{...}` to provide a plaintext version for bookmarks.
-   **Lesson**: **PDF bookmarks are plaintext.** Math, bold, and other formatting must be stripped for metadata.

## 66. The "List Item Bullet Missing" (v1.1.8)
-   **Symptom**: `\begin{itemize} \item Text \end{itemize}` appeared without bullet in preview.
-   **Root Cause**: CSS `list-style: none` was globally applied.
-   **Fix**: Override with `.latex-itemize li { list-style-type: disc !important; }`.
-   **Lesson**: **CSS resets kill semantic HTML.** Always restore list styles for `<ul>` and `<ol>`.

## 67. The "Equation Number Mismatch" (v1.1.10)
-   **Symptom**: Equation labeled as "Equation 1.2" in text but numbered as "2" in preview.
-   **Root Cause**: LaTeX section numbering (`1.2` = section 1, equation 2) vs. global numbering (equation 2).
-   **Fix**: Implement section-aware equation counting in preview.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX numbering is hierarchical.** Preview must replicate the chapter/section context.

## 68. The "Indented List inside Table" (v1.1.12)
-   **Symptom**: Lists (`\begin{itemize}`) inside table cells lost indentation.
-   **Root Cause**: Table CSS reset margins and padding globally.
-   **Fix**: Add `.latex-preview td ul { margin-left: 1em; }`.
-   **Lesson**: **Table cells are isolated contexts.** Restore list styling inside cells.

## 69. The "Footnote Numbering" (v1.1.15)
-   **Symptom**: Footnotes appeared as `[1], [1], [1]` instead of `[1], [2], [3]`.
-   **Root Cause**: Counter wasn't incremented.
-   **Fix**: Maintain a global footnote counter and increment on each `\footnote{}` command.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX has stateful counters.** Preview must replicate this state.

## 70. The "Whitespace After Command" (v1.0.5)
-   **Symptom**: `\LaTeX is great` appeared as `LaTeXis great` (missing space).
-   **Root Cause**: Command substitution (`\LaTeX` → `LaTeX`) consumed trailing space.
-   **Fix**: Preserve one trailing space after text-producing commands.
-   **Lesson**: **TeX swallows whitespace after commands.** Mimic this behavior but preserve semantic spacing.

## 71. The "Abstract Environment Not Recognized" (v1.0.8)
-   **Symptom**: `\begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}` appeared as literal text.
-   **Root Cause**: `latex.js` doesn't support `abstract` environment.
-   **Fix**: Extract content and render as styled `<div class="abstract">`.
-   **Lesson**: **latex.js is not comprehensive.** Custom environments need custom parsers.

## 72. The "Horizontal Line Thickness" (v1.0.10)
-   **Symptom**: `\hrule` appeared too thick in preview (5px instead of 1px).
-   **Root Cause**: CSS default `border-width` was 3px.
-   **Fix**: Set `.latex-hrule { border-top: 1px solid black; }`.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX defaults are razor-thin.** CSS defaults are "visible", which is too bold.

## 73. The "PageBreak in Preview" (v1.0.12)
-   **Symptom**: User added `\pagebreak` but preview showed no visual indicator.
-   **Fix**: Render `\pagebreak` as `<hr class="page-break">` with CSS to show a dashed line.
-   **Lesson**: **PDF and web pagination are different.** Fake it with visual markers.

## 74. The "Undefined Control Sequence \maketitle" (v1.0.15)
-   **Symptom**: LaTeX crashed with "Undefined control sequence \maketitle".
-   **Root Cause**: `\maketitle` was used but `\title{}`, `\author{}` were never defined.
-   **Fix**: Generate default `\title{Untitled}` and `\author{Unknown}` if not provided.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX commands have dependencies.** Provide sensible defaults.

## 75. The "Citation Style Override" (v1.0.18)
-   **Problem**: User wanted APA style but preamble used `natbib` with default style (numbering).
-   **Fix**: Made citation style a user setting and inject `\bibliographystyle{apalike}` accordingly.
-   **Lesson**: **Citation styles are user preference, not system decision.** Make it configurable.

## 76. The "Math Font Mismatch" (v1.0.20)
-   **Symptom**: Inline math (`$x$`) used serif font, but body text used sans-serif, creating visual discord.
-   **Fix**: KaTeX inherits font family from parent. Set `.latex-preview { font-family: 'Times New Roman'; }` for consistency.
-   **Lesson**: **Math typography should match body.** Ensure KaTeX and text fonts are harmonious.

## 77. The "Overloaded `\cite` Command" (v1.0.22)
-   **Symptom**: `\cite{ref_1, ref_2, ref_3}` crashed with "Too many arguments to \cite".
-   **Root Cause**: Some LaTeX distributions limit `\cite{}` to one key at a time.
-   **Fix**: Expand `\cite{a,b,c}` to `\cite{a}\cite{b}\cite{c}` during preprocessing.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX syntax varies by distribution.** Use the most compatible form.

## 78. The "Missing BibTeX File" (v0.9.5)
-   **Symptom**: Export crashed with "Couldn't find `.bib` file".
-   **Root Cause**: User downloaded `.tex` but not the companion `.bib` file.
-   **Fix**: Embed bibliography directly in `.tex` using `\begin{thebibliography}` instead of external `.bib`.
-   **Lesson**: **Minimize dependencies.** Standalone `.tex` files are easier for users.

## 79. The "Encoding Mismatch: UTF-8 vs. Latin-1" (v0.9.8)
-   **Symptom**: Special characters (ü, ñ, é) appeared as `Ã¼`, `Ã±`, `Ã©`.
-   **Root Cause**: User's LaTeX compiler expected Latin-1 but file was UTF-8.
-   **Fix**: Always include `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}` in preamble.
-   **Lesson**: **Encoding mismatches are silent until they break.** Declare encoding explicitly.

## 80. The "Nested Quote Escaping" (v0.9.10)
-   **Symptom**: Text like `He said "It's fine"` crashed with nesting error.
-   **Root Cause**: LaTeX requires ``` ``It's fine'' ``` (double backticks for open, double apostrophes for close).
-   **Fix**: Normalize Unicode quotes (`"` and `"`) to LaTeX syntax.
-   **Lesson**: **Typography is locale-specific.** LaTeX uses TeX conventions, not Unicode.

## 81. The "Long URL Line Break" (v0.8.2)
-   **Symptom**: Long URLs overflowed page width in PDF.
-   **Root Cause**: LaTeX doesn't break URLs by default.
-   **Fix**: Use `\usepackage{url}` and `\url{}` command (allows line breaks at `/`, `?`, `=`).
-   **Lesson**: **URLs need special handling.** Treat them as "breakable strings", not normal text.

## 82. The "Missing \\ at End of Table Row" (v0.8.5)
-   **Symptom**: Table rendering crashed with "Missing \\ inserted".
-   **Root Cause**: AI forgot `\\` at the end of some table rows.
-   **Fix**: Auto-append `\\` to table rows missing it during compilation.
-   **Lesson**: **AI forgets structural syntax.** Add defensive compilation to fix common omissions.

## 83. The "Too Many Math Fonts" (v0.7.2)
-   **Symptom**: PDF export crashed with "TeX capacity exceeded (font memory)".
-   **Root Cause**: Used both `amsfonts` and `amssymb` packages (redundant).
-   **Fix**: Only load `amssymb` (it includes `amsfonts`).
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX packages have implicit inclusions.** Loading both a package and its superset wastes memory.

## 84. The "Color in Math Mode" (v0.6.5)
-   **Symptom**: `\textcolor{red}{x^2}` appeared black in preview.
-   **Root Cause**: KaTeX doesn't support `\textcolor{}` by default.
-   **Fix**: Use KaTeX's `\color{}` command instead, or wrap in `\colorbox{}`.
-   **Lesson**: **KaTeX ≠ full LaTeX.** Check KaTeX documentation for supported commands.

## 85. The "JavaScript Escaping Confusion" (v1.9.69)
-   **Incident**: Bibliography URLs appeared with backslash prefix: `\https://...`.
-   **Root Cause**: JavaScript escaping error in `latexGenerator.ts`. Code had `\\\\url` which produces `\\url` (line break + `url`), not `\url` (URL command).
-   **The Math**:
    -   `\\\\` in JS = `\\` in string = LaTeX line break
    -   `\\url` in JS = `\url` in string = LaTeX URL command (CORRECT)
    -   Four backslashes is too many!
-   **Fix**: Changed `\\\\ \\\\url{...}` to `\\\\ \\url{...}`.
-   **Lesson**: **When generating LaTeX from JavaScript, count your backslashes carefully.** JS escaping + LaTeX escaping create a multiplication effect that's easy to get wrong.

## 87. The "Two-Layer Anti-Fabrication Defense" Pattern (v1.9.70)
-   **Incident**: AI generated "Empirical Validation" section with fabricated experiments.
-   **Root Cause 1**: Phase 1 (Strategist) planned a section requiring empirical data that didn't exist in source.
-   **Root Cause 2**: Phase 3 (Thinker) fabricated experiments to fill the planned section.
-   **The Gap**: Rule 7 in Phase 3 said "no fabrication" but Phase 1 could still plan fabrication-prone sections.
-   **Fix - Two Layers**:
    1. **Phase 1**: Added "ABSOLUTE PRINCIPLE - NO FABRICATION EVER" preventing planning of sections like "Empirical Validation" unless source has real data.
    2. **Phase 3**: Strengthened Rule 7 to "ZERO TOLERANCE" with explicit list of forbidden fabrications.
-   **Lesson**: **Defense in depth for AI behavior.** A single "don't" rule isn't enough. Block the *request* for harmful content (planning), AND block the *execution* of harmful content (writing). The AI will find loopholes if only one layer exists.

## 88. The "Universal Handler" Approach (v1.9.68)
-   **Incident**: `\quad`, `\leq`, `\alpha`, and 50+ other commands appeared as literal text.
-   **Root Cause**: `parseLatexFormatting()` only handled a subset of LaTeX commands.
-   **The Pattern**: Each "unhandled command" bug was fixed one-at-a-time. This is slow and whack-a-mole.
-   **Solution**: Research-based bulk addition of all common LaTeX commands based on "Most Used LaTeX Commands" lists.
-   **Categories Added**: Math symbols, logic operators, set theory, Greek letters, arrows, spacing, layout.
-   **Lesson**: **When fixing missing handlers, don't fix one - fix all.** Research the domain and add comprehensive coverage. The cost of adding 50 handlers is barely more than adding 1, but it prevents 49 future bug reports.

## 89. The "Primitive JSON Parsing Trap" (v1.9.71)
-   **Incident**: Phase 2 (Librarian) crashed with "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 7".
-   **Root Cause**: `extractJson` in `server/ai/utils.ts` accepted JSON primitives (numbers, strings, booleans). When AI output text like `0 papers found`, the parser treated `0` as valid JSON, then crashed on "papers".
-   **Why Primitives Are Dangerous**: All pipeline phases expect structured responses (Objects/Arrays per schema). Accepting primitives allowed error messages to be misidentified as "valid output".
-   **Fix**: Added strict enforcement:
    ```typescript
    if (start === -1) {
        throw new Error(`No JSON object or array found (expected { or [). First 50 chars: "${clean.substring(0, 50)}..."`);
    }
    ```
-   **Impact**: Now rejects responses without `{` or `[`, surfaces actual failures with content preview.
-   **Lesson**: **Type validation should match schema expectations.** If all valid responses are Objects/Arrays, enforce it at parse time - don't accept primitives "just in case".

## 90. The "Swallow Exception Anti-Pattern" (v1.9.72)
-   **Incident**: User reported "AI response was not valid JSON" but couldn't debug why.
-   **Root Cause**: OpenRouter adapter caught exceptions from `extractJson` and replaced them with generic error:
    ```typescript
    catch (e: any) {
        throw new Error("AI response was not valid JSON"); // Loses e.message!
    }
    ```
-   **Result**: Actual error (e.g., "402 Payment Required") was hidden, wasting debugging time.
-   **Fix**: Propagate inner exception:
    ```typescript
    throw new Error(`AI response was not valid JSON: ${e.message || String(e)}`);
    ```
-   **Dev Principle**: **Always propagate inner exceptions.** Generic error messages look "clean" but destroy debugging information. Errors should be a breadcrumb trail, not a dead end.
-   **Lesson**: **Hiding errors is never a feature.** Users and developers need context to diagnose failures.

## 91. The "User Prompt vs. System Prompt" Pattern (v1.9.73)
-   **Incident**: "Empirical Validation: Hong Kong Deployments" section appeared despite System Prompt forbidding fabrication.
-   **Root Cause**: LLMs often deprioritize System Prompts (general rules) in favor of User Prompts (immediate task).
-   **Solution - Dual Defense**: 
    1. **System Prompt**: Sets general behavior ("never fabricate").
    2. **User Prompt**: Enforces it at instruction level ("Do NOT plan 'Empirical Validation' unless...").
-   **LLM Behavior**: User prompts are interpreted as "What I must do right now" and override general tendencies from system prompts.
-   **Lesson**: **Critical constraints belong in BOTH prompts.** System prompt = policy, User prompt = contract. The AI reads them differently; exploit both channels.

## 92. The "Algorithm Package Case Mismatch" (v1.9.74)
-   **Incident**: Line 616: `\REQUIRE` → "Undefined control sequence" error.
-   **Root Cause**: AI output uppercase commands (`\REQUIRE`, `\STATE`) but `algpseudocode` package uses mixed-case (`\Require`, `\State`). The legacy `algorithmic` package uses uppercase, but `algpseudocode` is the modern standard.
-   **Why Mixed-Case**: `algpseudocode` provides better control flow formatting and is actively maintained.
-   **Fix**: Added automatic normalization to `sanitizeLatexForExport`:
    - `\REQUIRE` → `\Require`, `\ENSURE` → `\Ensure`, `\STATE` → `\State`, plus all variants.
-   **Design Decision**: Normalize at export time (not generation) to preserve preview compatibility.
-   **Lesson**: **AI learns from mixed corpuses.** It sees both old (`algorithmic`) and new (`algpseudocode`) package syntax in training data. Normalize to the modern standard automatically.

## 93. The "Text Mode Math Mode Conflict" (v1.9.75)
-   **Incident**: Line 790: `\text{Integrity}(A, C) \geq $\theta$` → "Missing $ inserted".
-   **Root Cause**: AI wrapped algorithm keywords in `\text{}` (a math-mode command), but algorithm environments are already in text mode. This created a mode conflict: `\text{}` expects to be *inside* math mode, but was used in text mode.
-   **Why It Fails**: `\text{}` is for inserting normal text *inside math equations* (e.g., `$x^2 \text{ for all } x$`). Using it in text mode is backwards.
-   **Fix**: Strip `\text{}` wrappers from algorithm blocks: `\text{Integrity}` → `Integrity`, `\text{if}` → `if`.
-   **Lesson**: **LaTeX modes are mutually exclusive.** Text mode commands (`\textbf{}`) vs. math mode commands (`\text{}`) serve different purposes. AI sometimes uses them interchangeably; sanitize based on context (environment type).

## 94. The "BOM (Byte Order Mark) Silent Corruption" (v1.9.76)
-   **Incident**: pdflatex failed on line 1 with "Undefined control sequence \documentclass".
-   **Symptom**: The error was confusing because `\documentclass` is the *most fundamental* LaTeX command - it should never be "undefined".
-   **Root Cause**: Express `res.send(string)` was adding UTF-8 BOM (`EF BB BF`) to the exported file. LaTeX parsers expect files to start with `\` (ASCII 92), not `EF BB BF`.
-   **Why BOM Breaks LaTeX**: The BOM bytes are invisible in most text editors, but LaTeX sees them as garbage before the `\documentclass` command, which violates the "nothing before `\documentclass`" rule.
-   **Fix**: Changed export endpoint from `res.send(exportSafeLatex)` to `res.send(Buffer.from(exportSafeLatex, 'utf-8'))`. `Buffer.from()` ensures binary-safe output without BOM.
-   **Detection Technique**: Open file in hex editor and check first bytes. If they are `EF BB BF` instead of `5C 64` (`\d`), BOM is present.
-   **Lesson**: **Express defaults are web-centric, not LaTeX-friendly.** Use `Buffer` for binary-safe text file exports. BOM is invisible to humans but fatal to LaTeX.

## 95. The "Paragraph Formatting Preference Mismatch" (v1.9.77)
-   **User Request**: "I want paragraphs separated by line breaks, not first-word indentation."
-   **LaTeX Default**: Uses first-line indentation (`\parindent=1em`) with no spacing between paragraphs.
-   **User Preference**: Modern/web-style - no indentation, visible line break between paragraphs.
-   **Solution**: Added to LaTeX preamble in `latexGenerator.ts`:
    ```latex
    \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}   % Remove first-line indentation
    \setlength{\parskip}{1em}     % Add line break between paragraphs
    ```
-   **Preview Compatibility**: CSS already had `text-indent: 0` and `margin-bottom: 1em`, so change was seamless.
-   **Lesson**: **Typography preferences vary.** LaTeX defaults are academic/print-style, but users often prefer web-style spacing. Make it configurable or default to modern conventions.

## 96. The "Nested Iterator" Bug (v1.9.78)
-   **Symptom**: Nested lists (e.g., `enumerate` inside `algorithm`) appeared empty, and `\end{enumerate}` appeared as literal text.
-   **Root Cause**: The manually written `processLists` function extracted `\item` content using a loop that stopped at *any* `\item` or `\end` tag, ignoring nesting depth.
-   **The Failure**: When it encountered a nested `\begin{enumerate} \item ...`, it saw the nested `\item` and stopped capturing the parent item's content, truncating the nested list entirely.
-   **Fix**: Rewrote the extraction loop to track `nestedListDepth`. It now consumes nested `\begin/end` blocks atomically and only stops at a top-level `\item`.
-   **Lesson**:
    1. **Manual Parsers must be Recursion-Aware.** If you write a `while` loop to parse a tree structure, you effectively need a stack (or a depth counter). "Flat" scanning always fails on nested structures.
    2. **Mathematical Plot Safety (v1.9.80)**: Layout algorithms (like "Fill Width") often destroy Mathematical Truth. Applying `x=1.8` non-proportional scaling to a plot `y=1/x` turned circles into ellipses and distorted functions. **Mathematical plots require Aspect Ratio Locking (Square Scaling)**.
    3. **The Global Clip Trap (v1.9.82)**: When fixing unbounded plots (asymptotes), a "Global Clip" (`\clip (min,min) rectangle (max,max)`) is dangerous because it cuts off explicit labels (like "Axis Title") that float outside the grid. **Clipping must be Local (Scoped)** to the specific element causing the overflow.
    4. **The Digital Cliff (v1.9.83)**: Using step functions for UI scaling (e.g., `if width > 7 then scale=1.8 else scale=1.3`) creates jarring user experiences. A small change in input (6.9 -> 7.1) causes a massive jump in output. **Use Continuous Math** (e.g., `scale = Target / Width`) to ensure smooth, predictable behavior.

## 97. The "Magic Number" Shadow Bug (v1.9.79)
-   **Symptom**: An extra `}` appeared after algorithms, and sometimes content following a list was swallowed.
-   **Root Cause**: In the manual `processLists` parser, the line `i += 15;` (handling `\end{enumerate}`) was accidentally duplicated during a copy-paste refactor.
-   **The Failure**: The first `i += 15` correctly skipped the `\end{enumerate}` tag. The *second* `i += 15` blindly skipped the *next* 15 characters of the document (often `\end{algorithm}` or valuable text), leaving behind corrupted artifacts like orphaned braces.
-   **Lesson**: **Avoid "Magic Number" skips in parsers.** Instead of `i += 15`, use `i += tag.length` or functions like `consume(tag)`. If you must use offsets, unit test the *exact* transition points. Visual code inspection of manual parsers is prone to missing "double lines".

## 101. The Console Noise Floor (v1.9.84)
- **Problem**: Verbose log messages (`[Drafting] Section 3: The geopolitical implications of... (15805 chars)...`) were wrapping to multiple lines, destroying the visual "heartbeat" of the terminal.
- **Insight**: Users perceive system health via the *rhythm* of logs. Erratic wrapping looks like panic; steady single lines look like progress.
- **Solution**: **Design for the Terminal Row**. Hard-truncate dynamic content (titles) to ~60 chars and push metrics (character counts) to the end.
- **The Format**: `[Phase] Content... (N chars)`. This minimizes visual noise while maximizing information density per row.

## 102. The Unlimited Resource Trap (v1.9.85)
- **Problem**: "Advanced" mode was treated as "Unlimited Queries", leading the Strategist to generate 50+ queries. This didn't improve quality; it just diluted the context window with marginal results.
- **Lesson**: **Luxury needs Boundaries.** Even "Advanced" users benefit from curation. A strict cap of 20 high-quality queries yields better synthesis than 50 mediocre ones. "More" is not essentially "Better" in RAG systems; "Relevant" is better.

## 103. The Leak in the Abstract (v1.9.86)
- **Problem**: The generated Abstract contained "Listening to..." and "Thinking..." artifacts (`> ...`) because it bypassed the standard `sanitizeLatexOutput` pipeline used for sections.
- **Lesson**: **Uniform Sanitization is non-negotiable.** Even "safe" short-form content can contain chain-of-thought debris. Apply the same rigorous cleaning pipeline to *every* AI output string, regardless of its source or length.

## 104. The Color of Rigor (v1.9.87)
- **Problem**: The AI hallucinated `darkgreen` (undefined in TikZJax), crashing the preview. Primary colors (`red`, `blue`) also looked amateurish.
- **Solution**: Injected a "Color Polyfill" into `tikz-engine.ts` that redefines standard colors to academic shades (Red->Maroon) and defines missing ones (`darkgreen`), ensuring stability and aesthetic rigor.

## 105. The Unclosed Tag (v1.9.89)
- **Problem**: A "Total Breakdown" of the preview occurred where raw LaTeX code (headers, algorithms) was displayed instead of rendered HTML.
- **Root Cause**: The regex parsers in `processor.ts` used strict matching (expecting valid `\end{...}` tags). When the AI generated truncated content (missing end tag), the regex failed to match, leaving the content as raw text.
- **Solution**: Implemented a "Safety Sweep" that runs after all processors. It detects any remaining `\begin{...}` content and wraps it in a `<pre class="latex-error-block">` container. This ensures that even broken code is contained and doesn't disrupt the flow of the document.
- **Lesson**: **Fail Gracefully, Don't Fail Open.** In parsing pipelines, if a specific parser fails, the fallback shouldn't be "dump raw text mixed with content". It should be "encapsulate and warn".

- **Insight**: Asking the AI to "be professional" is flaky. **Enforcing** professionalism via the engine is robust.
- **Solution**: **The Palette Polyfill**. We implicitly redefined standard colors (`red`, `blue`) to "Prestige Shades" (`Maroon`, `Navy`) inside the engine. This fixes the crash (by defining `darkgreen`) and guarantees a pro look without trusting the AI to follow style guides.

## 106. The Unsafe Replacement (v1.9.95)
- **Problem**: A `parseLatexFormatting` text cleanup rule intended to convert `\cap` to `∩` lacked word boundaries. It matched the prefix of `\caption`, corrupting it to `∩tion`. This caused the Algorithm regex to fail (mismatched body) and the Safety Sweep to swallow subsequent headers (caused by destabilized text parsing).
- **Lesson**: **Regex Replacements are Surgical Implants.** Never use global replacements for short strings (like `\in`, `\cap`, `\cup`) without strict lookaheads (`(?![a-zA-Z])`) or word boundaries. A 3-letter match is statistically guaranteed to collide with unintended targets in a large corpus.

## 107. The Protection Paradox (v1.9.97)
- **Problem**: A "Safety Sweep" intended to catch broken code caused the code to break.
- **Scenario**: The Normalizer regex used `\begin{algorithm}` (strict), but the Safety Sweep used `\begin\s*{algorithm}` (lax).
- **Mechanism**: The Normalizer failed to clean up a block with extra spaces. The Safety Sweep then saw it as "unprocessed" and wrapped it in a Red Error Box, deleting the content.
- **Lesson**: **Validators must use the SAME regex as Parsers.** If the cop (Validator) is stricter than the cleaner (Parser), the cop will arrest the trash usage left behind. Synchronize your regexes across the entire pipeline.

## 108. The Algorithm Nested List Failure (v1.9.98)
- **Problem**: Lists inside Algorithms (`\begin{enumerate}`) were not rendering (raw text).
- **Root Cause**: The global `processLists` function explicitly *skipped* algorithm blocks to prevent corruption (Lesson 21). This meant lists *inside* those blocks were never processed.
- **Fix**: Implemented **Scoped List Processing**. Inside the Algorithm Handler, we explicitly invoke `processLists(body)` *before* wrapping it in the algorithm container.
- **Lesson**: **Exclusion implies Responsibility.** If you exclude a block from the global pipeline (to protect it), you become responsible for running local pipelines inside it. You cannot just "skip and forget".

## 109. Destructive Flattening (v1.9.99)
- **Problem**: TikZ diagrams were disappearing purely because they were wrapped in `\begin{figure}`.
- **Mechanism**: The "Flattening" logic (intended to inline floating figures) was **Destructive**: `text.replace(/\\begin\{figure\}.*?$/gm, '')`. It deleted the wrapper AND the caption, often corrupting the content inside.
- **Fix**: Switched to **Non-Destructive Flattening**. Replaced `\begin{figure}` with `<div class="latex-figure-wrapper">`.

## 110. The xAI "Response" Endpoint (v1.9.102)
- **Problem**: xAI's standard chat completion endpoint (`/chat/completions`) provides generic responses, but for **Agentic Search**, the documentation requires a specific `/responses` endpoint with a different schema.
- **Incident**: Using `grok-beta` or standard models on the chat endpoint resulted in "404 Not Found" or simple text generation without search.
- **Fix**: Implemented strict **Non-Streaming REST** calls to `https://api.x.ai/v1/responses`.
  - **Schema**: `input: [{ role: "user", content: ... }]` (different from `messages`).
  - **Streaming**: Disabled (`stream: false`) because the streaming chunks for Agentic Search are complex/unstable compared to the reliable JSON final response.
- **Lesson**: **Read the specific guide for "Agentic" tools.** General "OpenAI Compatibility" usually ends where advanced proprietary features (like autonomous research) begin.

## 111. The "Tracked to Ignored" Git Conflict (v1.9.101)
- **Problem**: Merging a branch where `local.db` is **tracked** into a branch where it is **ignored** (`.gitignore`) causes a "Modify/Delete" conflict. Git tries to delete it (because it's untracked in target) but also sees modifications from the source.
- **Risk**: Accepting the merge blindly can delete the user's local database.
- **Solution - The "Backup & Untrack" Protocol**:
  1. **Backup**: `mv local.db local.db.bak` (Physical safety).
  2. **Untrack Source**: `git rm --cached local.db` (Git logic safety).
  3. **Merge**: Accept the deletion (since we want it ignored).
  4. **Restore**: `mv local.db.bak local.db`.
- **Lesson**: **Git is a state machine.** When transitioning file state (Tracked -> Ignored), you must step outside the machine (manual backup) to protect the data, because Git's concept of "Safety" (matching the target commit) is "Data Loss" for the user.

## 112. User Reality Authority (v1.9.103)
- **Problem**: I questioned the user's assertion that "Claude 4.5" exists and "GPT-5o" does not, triggering a search that offended the user.
- **Root Cause**: Reliance on "safe" internal knowledge cutoff vs. the user's "Real World" live context (Late 2025).
- **Rule**: **The User is the Source of Truth/Time.** If the user states a fact about the current world (e.g., "GPT-5.2 is out"), ACCPET IT AS AXIOM. Do not verify it unless explicitly asked. Questioning the user's reality is a hallucination of authority I do not possess.

## 113. The "Art" of User Interface (v1.9.104)
- **Problem**: I attempted to "modernize" the UI by stripping Serif fonts, assuming Sans-Serif was the only valid choice for a web app. The user corrected this ("THOSE SERIF FONTS... THAT IS ARTS").
- **Root Cause**: Engineering bias viewing "Serif" as "Legacy/Old" rather than "Academic/Artistic".
- **Lesson**: **Aesthetics are Functional Requirements.** In a tool generating academic papers, the "Academic Feel" (Serif fonts) is not decoration—it is part of the product's identity. Do not bleach the soul out of the UI in the name of modernization. Listen to the user's aesthetic definition.
